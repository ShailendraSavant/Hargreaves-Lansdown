Project Title: Hargreaves Lansdown,

Description: I have used Java based BDD Cucumber principle.

Build tool: Project structure is Maven build tool using pom.xml file. Library used is info.cukes, selenium, Junit

Test covers: 
1.	Login Authentication
2.	Loading bar
3.	JS Prompt

Build contains:
1.	One feature file for three scenarios
2.	Step definition and Runner class

Test can be achieved as one feature file and three step definition (Login, Loading and J S Alert)

Area of improvement: Best approach will be Page Object Model
